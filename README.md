# recommendations

A recommendation system that supports different recommendation methods (user-based, item-based) and distance measures (Minkowski distance, Cosine similarity, Pearson Correlation Coefficient), and that can determine why a particular item is being recommended.

This system is the result of following Ron Zacharski's "A Programmer's Guide to Data Mining: The Ancient Art of the Numerati", and will continue to be updated as I progress through the book.
